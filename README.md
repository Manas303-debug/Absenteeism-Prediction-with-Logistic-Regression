# Absenteeism-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a predictive model for absenteeism using logistic regression. The goal of this project is to analyze factors that contribute to employee absenteeism and build a model to predict whether an employee is likely to be absent for more than 3 Hours.<br>
<br>
Data Exploration: Explore and analyze the absenteeism dataset to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns.<br>
<br>
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables for modeling.<br>
<br>
Logistic Regression Model: Implement a logistic regression model to predict absenteeism based on relevant features.<br>
<br>
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
<br>
Interactive Jupyter Notebook: The entire analysis and model building process are documented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.<br>
